# Simple_Laravel_Chat_System
### Author: Haghani Hakimi

#### Overview:

This is my first Laravel app that I created recently. As I decided to learn Laravel, I had this idea to create a simple chat system using Laravel and Vue 2.<br/>
In this app, users can create and manage their accounts. They can make their account private or public!
##### Features of this app:
1. Creating and managing accounts
2. Managing account privacy<br/>
   - Users can set their account to private or LOCKED to prevent receiving unwanted friend requests!<br/>
   - Users can mark any friend requests as SPAM so targeted users (who's marked as spam) can't send any more requests.
3. Sending and receving friend requests
3. Users can block or unblock other users.
4. Users can add extra security to their account<br/>
    - Users can enable 2-Factor Authentication feature to verify security code before logging to their account.

And there are some more features in this simple application.<br/>

##### Technologies used in this app:
1. HTML & CSS
2. PHP Laravel & Vue JS 2
3. MySQL & Redis
4. Laravel Pusher

#### Default user account password:
The default password for user account is: **123456789**

#### Basic requirements to run and test application:
1. NPM/NodeJS
2. PHP Composer
3. Pusher account to have required keys
4. MailTrap account to have reuqired keys

#### Note: Laravel DebugBar is installed. Keep APP_DEBUG to TRUE to be able to use this tool during Development Stage.

#### PS:
There can be bugs and some problems in every project and this one also may have some issues too!
There will be regular changes/updates to this project to inject my new knowledges and improvements to this project time-to-time in the future!
